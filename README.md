# podcast-rss-generator
A quick-and-dirty Podcast RSS Generator for my personal use. Feel free to adapt, and reuse if useful to your needs. 
I use this to turn audio files I have into a Podcast that I can listen to using my preferred Podcast Player. 

Shoutout to [Podcast Addict](https://podcastaddict.com/) for being my favorite players and being a reliable companion all these years. 

### Usage
- Keep the generator.py in the folder of audio files. 
- This assumes audio files of the same format.
- Install Dependency `pip install mutagen`.
- Run the generator `python generator.py` and give the necessary details.
